# The Concordia Sacrae Website

At this point the Concordia Sacrae website is a trivial single HTML5 + trivial JS page and is out of date.  The new Website is in the early stages of development.
So early, in fact, that the tech stack has not been selected, where to host the site has not been selected, and the team is in the process of being formed.
See the Wiki for a discussion on the requirements and design of the website.
